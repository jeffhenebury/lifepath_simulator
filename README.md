# lifepath_simulator
The TTRPG "The Witcher" uses an extensive lifepath system. I'd like to streamline it and possibly make a discord add-on for it.
* 1/5/2022: For the purpose of this project, I will exclusively be using the FREE Witcher: Easy Mode.
* 1/11/2022Easy Mode Life Path has been outlined...need to consider how to improve efficiency of Lists with duplicates.
* Next begin Stat rolling and User Input for stat selection.
